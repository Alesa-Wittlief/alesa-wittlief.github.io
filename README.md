This is my personal portfolio website built with HTML and CSS. It highlights my background as a business owner and community builder as I transition into front-end development.

This project was created to:

- Practice semantic HTML structure
- Build responsive layouts using Flexbox
- Improve my understanding of CSS styling and layout systems
- Deploy a live website using GitHub Pages

The site includes:

- A homepage introducing my background and professional journey
- A resume page with structured experience, skills, and education
- A responsive layout that adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens
- Custom styling including a textured background and subtle interactive effects

Technologies Used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- GitHub Pages for deployment

Responsive Design:

The layout adjusts for smaller screens using media queries.  
Sections that appear side-by-side on desktop stack vertically on mobile devices.
