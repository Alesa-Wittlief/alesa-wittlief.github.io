                As a soloprenuer, I have a naturally adventurous spirit and a passion for living life to the fullest. I try to live my life in such a way that I give back as 
                much as I can to the world around me. I have a strong desire to learn and grow until the day I die. I'd love to see as much of the world as possible, as well. 
                Only by understanding cultures outside of our own can we truly love and grow as human beings. 
            </p>

                Before transitioning into learning coding, I had a modestly successful career as a coffee shop owner. Little did I know the value of community 
                and connection until I built my business around it. While owning the coffeehouse, I learned how to impact my community more by hosting fundraisers for those
                in medical need, or by organizing art-night patio events that grew to an old-town, monthly event with bigger bands and brought in business to my neighbors, too. 
                While I loved owning the coffee shop, I yearned for other experiences - to be free to travel and to also try Real Estate!             </p>
